# A Simple Introduction
As a sophomore currently studying General Relativity, I recently engaged with MIT's lecture series under my research supervisor's guidance. Alongside completing standard coursework, I aim to document my problem-solving methodologies and conceptual insights here. Any critical feedback or corrections from the community would be greatly appreciated.
